	<section class ="section1">
		
		<h3>Presenting</h3>
		<p>The way of presentation of all the courses and the respective videos held by each and every modules of which the course we took are extraordinary and every person who are having less and least knowledge about coding would come to a very good achievement of handling coding </p>

		<h3>Tutor</h3>
		<p>The Tutor , he always trying to teach in  a perfect way that an online teaching can have and i felt like am having a real face to face interaction section with him. Teaches in a way that every student who took HTML course would understand the course clearly, no matter what, even if he doesn't have a coding skill</p>

	<section class="section3">
		<h3>Commitment</h3>
		<p>The way that they keep their commitment towards each and every student is really high. They want each and everyone who took their course to complete it. no matter you fail in exams they conduct and unable to complete the modules before deadlines, you get the opportunity to reset our deadline and have retesting to our exams that's what COMMITMENT sounds</p>
